"SoftMonster"
"When creatures enter a dungeon or building they will be given the ability to carry as much as they like.
Dungeons and buildings are identified by areas surrounded by doors or gates.
Basically, get rid of the weight requirements for carrying capacity when looting or equipping.

Note: All Softmonster mods are licensed under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (especially for use by Michal if possible).
I just want to improve the game for everyone.
When you derive mods from this code, please keep the licensing file: COPYING in your mod directory.
