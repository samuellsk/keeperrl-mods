"SoftMonster"
"GoAnywhere allows you to travel the whole campaign map and exposes you to all tribes from the beginning.

It plays a lot more like the old style single-map games where you were on one big map.

Note: All Softmonster mods are licensed under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (especially for use by Michal if possible).
I just want to improve the game for everyone.
When you derive mods from this code, please keep the licensing file: COPYING in your mod directory.
